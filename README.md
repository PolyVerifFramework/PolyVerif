# PolyVerif FrameWork

## PolyVerif AV Validation Suite

This is Poly-Verification and Validation Suite. Its functionality is to generate the test cases and validate the autonomous stack.
It integrate the Python and Scenic scenario description language with AutowareAuto and helps to generate the random scenario for simulation.
Since we are using OSSDC Simulator and AutowareAuto, it will require a high-end server with Graphics card to run it smoothly. 

This document contains the information of installing and setup the component for running Poly_Suite framework. It requires below setup, libraries and package that are need to be install in sequence as mention below.

The Simulator performance will be very slow if run on a lower PC configuration.
