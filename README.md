# PolyVerif FrameWork

PolyVerif AV Validation Suite

This is Poly-Verification and Validation Suite. Its functionality is to generate the test cases and validate the autonomous stack.
It integrates Python and the Scenic scenario description language with AutowareAuto to help generate random scenarios for simulation.
